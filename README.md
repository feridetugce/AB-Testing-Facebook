# A/B-Testing.py
Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, “average bidding”, as an alternative to its existing bidding type, called “maximum bidding”. One of our clients, bombabomba.com, has decided to test this new feature and wants to conduct an A/B test to understand if average bidding brings more conversions than maximum bidding.

In this study, bombabomba.com randomly splits its audience into two equally sized groups the test and the control. A Facebook ad campaign with “maximum bidding” is served to the “control group” and another campaign with “average bidding” is served to the “test group”.

For the existing 1-month test, bombabomba.com now expects you to analyze the results of this A/B test.

Impression: The number of times an ad is displayed.
Click: The number of clicks on ad links 
Purchase: Number of products purchased after ads clicked
Earning: Earning after purchasing products

Warning!!!!!!!
I should point out that I cannot share the dataset because it is not open source.
